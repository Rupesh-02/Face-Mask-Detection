# Face-Mask-Detection
This project is a real-time face mask detection system built using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV. It detects whether a person is wearing a face mask by using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is designed for use in public safety applications such as entrance monitoring, smart surveillance, and healthcare facilities.
